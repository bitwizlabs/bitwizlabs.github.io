## Welcome to bitwizlabs

I'm **bitwiz**, an FPGA engineer focused on high-performance digital systems, streaming architectures, and verification automation.

This site is where I share projects, techniques, and tools from my work. Everything here is meant to be practical and applicable to real designs.

## What you'll find here

### [Projects](/projects/)

Deep dives into FPGA subsystems I've built. Each project includes architecture overviews, implementation notes, verification strategy, and lessons learned. These range from DDR4 memory controllers to high-speed SerDes integration.

### [Lab Notes](/lab-notes/)

Shorter, more experimental posts documenting things I've tried in the lab. Some succeeded, some failed, all taught me something. These are less polished than articles but more immediate.

### [Articles](/articles/)

Technical notes on verification, timing closure, and the craft of RTL design. Longer-form content with more structure and polish.

### [About](/about/)

More about my background and what I focus on.

### [Now](/now/)

What I'm currently working on and thinking about.

## Where to start

If you're new here, I'd recommend starting with:

1. **[DDR4 Subsystem Architecture](/projects/ddr4-subsystem/)** - A complete memory subsystem walkthrough
2. **[Verification Framework](/projects/verification-framework/)** - Cocotb and SVA methodologies I use
3. **[About](/about/)** - Learn more about my background
