## About bitwiz

I'm Alexis, an FPGA engineer with 5+ years building high-performance digital systems.

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisblopez/)

### Background

My work spans **medical devices**, **big tech infrastructure**, and **custom silicon** projects. I specialize in:

- **Streaming systems** - High-throughput data pipelines and DMA engines
- **SerDes integration** - Multi-gigabit serial links (PCIe, Ethernet, custom)
- **Verification automation** - Cocotb frameworks, SVA, constrained random
- **Timing closure** - Clock domain crossings, multicycle paths, physical optimization

### Philosophy

> Write RTL like someone else will have to debug it at 2am. Because that someone might be you.

I believe in:
- **Readable code** over clever code
- **Assertions everywhere** - if it can go wrong, check it
- **Automation** - if you do it twice, script it
- **Documentation** - but not too much

### This Site

bitwiz is where I share projects, techniques, and tools from my work. Everything here is meant to be practical and applicable to real designs.
